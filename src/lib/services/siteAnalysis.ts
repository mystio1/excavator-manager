/**
 * Site Analysis: the ONE place that turns work records into per-site / per-machine / per-day figures.
 * The Site Analysis pages, /api/sites*, the customer site card and the dashboard "Site Analysis"
 * totals all call into this file, so no screen has a formula of its own.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * WORK ENTRIES (single source of truth, built in SQL by `entriesCte`)
 *   - every APPROVED DailyWorkLog (PENDING / REJECTED never count). A DIESEL_ONLY log counts its
 *     diesel and 0 hours.
 *   - every WorkSession that has NO daily logs at all (operator job flow) = ONE entry dated
 *     session.startDate with hours = totalHours, attachment = session.attachment, diesel =
 *     session.dieselLiters. (A running job with 0 hours and no diesel is skipped.)
 *     Sessions WITH logs are counted only through their logs, so session-level diesel (which is
 *     rolled up from the logs) is never added twice.
 *
 * WORK TYPE: attachment containing "bucket" -> BUCKET, "breaker"/"brekar" -> BREAKER (the
 * AttachmentPicker values are Bucket / Breaker / Chaining); anything else (Chaining, empty) ->
 * OTHER: its hours are shown but it is unpriced.
 *
 * REVENUE (per entry)
 *   - session already BILLED (a BillItem points at it): the entry carries its share of
 *     BillItem.amount (amount x entry hours / session hours), so billed work always equals the real
 *     invoice and a later rate change can never alter it.
 *   - otherwise hours x the rate in force on the work date: the latest SiteRateHistory row with
 *     effectiveFrom <= the date (work before the first row uses the first row; a site with no
 *     history rows falls back to the site's current rate). OTHER work is 0.
 *   Total Revenue = billed (BillItem amounts) + unbilled work valued at site rates
 *   (exposed separately as billedRevenue / unbilledRevenue).
 *
 * RECEIVED = payments allocated to the site's bill items proportionally:
 *   item share x bill.paidAmount / bill.totalAmount (financials.ts).
 * PENDING  = Revenue - Received  (e.g. 5,82,000 - 4,62,000 = 1,20,000). Unbilled work is pending.
 * Customer-level figures (billed/received/pending across ALL of a customer's bills) come from the
 * same Bill/Payment records through financials.ts and are shown beside, never added to, site figures.
 *
 * MACHINES WORKING AT A SITE: an Excavator with status WORKING (not archived) whose
 * currentSiteId is the site OR which has an ACTIVE WorkSession at the site. Dashboard
 * "machines working" counts distinct such machines.
 *
 * DAILY READING ROW: one row per (day, machine). Total Hours = meter hours (end - start) per entry
 * when both meters exist and end >= start, otherwise the entry's recorded hoursWorked (a stored
 * end < start is flagged, and hoursWorked is used). Bucket / Brekar / Other hours are the recorded
 * hours split by attachment. Reading Difference = Total Hours - (Bucket + Brekar), i.e. meter
 * hours not assigned to Bucket or Brekar (Chaining / other / not specified). "Average" = diesel litres
 * per working hour of that row. All figures are tenant-scoped by businessId.
